Dependencies

Back End Dependencies

Express.JS
Express apps utilize routers that are essentially containers for a set of middleware. We can put this middleware holder only on a certain route, which allows us to keep our logic in separate files and bring them together on our terms! We are going to build a very simple car API. We will be implementing the following routes in the application.

Front End Dependencies

For my front-end I used plain old html and css, calling on bootstrap quite a bit.
